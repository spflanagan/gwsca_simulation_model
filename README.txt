gwsca_simulation_model
This program runs an individual-based simulation model in which alleles in adults and offpsring are 
compared using Fst.
This program accompanies Flanagan & Jones 2015 (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1546/full)

The parameters to change are found in the first few lines of int main() in the life_cycle.cpp file and in the SetParameters() function in Class Population the populations.h file.

The program can be compiled with any C++ compiler (e.g. g++ -std=c++0x). 

Any questions should be directed to sflanagan@bio.tamu.edu
